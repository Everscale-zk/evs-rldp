## About

Implementation of Reliable Large Datagram Protocol (RLDP) in safe Rust. RLDP is a protocol that runs on top of ADNL UDP, which is used to transfer large data blocks and includes Forward Error Correction (FEC) algorithms as a replacement of acknowledgment packets on the other side. This makes it possible to transfer data between network components more efficiently, but with more traffic consumption.
